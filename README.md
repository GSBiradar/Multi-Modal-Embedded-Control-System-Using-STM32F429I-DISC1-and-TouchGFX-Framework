# Multi-Modal-Embedded-Control-System-Using-STM32F429I-DISC1-and-TouchGFX-Framework
Advanced embedded HMI system controlling STM32F429I-DISC1 on-board LEDs via TouchGFX GUI. Features touch-screen buttons for LED13/LED14 control and joystick-operated virtual LED visualization. Complete embedded GUI implementation with hardware integration.
![## System Demonstration
The image showcases the operational hardware setup of our embedded control system. The STM32F429I-DISCO board displays the TouchGFX GUI on its integrated LCD while simultaneously controlling the physical LEDs (PG13 and PG14) based on user interactions. This demonstrates the seamless integration between the graphical interface and hardware peripherals - touch buttons toggle the actual LEDs, and joystick movements control virtual elements on the display.]<img width="200" height="500" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/915a1a91-380c-4ba8-8ae3-ac4c8eb3e85f">
